    <Data-Processing>
All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)

All fastq format reads were assessed for quality control using FASTQC software (v0.11.8).
The Illumina sequencing platform-specific adaptors and poor quality read bases were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.5).
The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome  with STAR aligner (v2.6.0) and the output sam/bam files were obtained.
Gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v1.2.23)
normalized through DESeq2 BiocManager package (v1.20.0)
